# UofU_Full-Stack_Course Prework Study guide Webpage



## Description

- This is the completed pre-work for the UofU Fullstack coding Boot Camp that materializes as a website with an interactive console.

- This was built to act as a brief recap and study guide for the basics of web development.

- This allows me to be be able to reference this project to help refresh me on the fundamentals incase I got lost or stuck along my path of learning.

- In building this project I became much more familiar with git and github and had a good refresher on html, css, and javascript.



## Installation

- I would put something here if you had to install anything but since you are already here you are already set to view and use the project.



## Usage

- Head to the site that this project is hosted on and view the material.
- If you would like to use the interactive portion of the project to help you study then,
    - open the chrome dev console.
    - open th colsole portion of the Dev tool.
    - now you can view the randomly chosen topic for you to study!


## Credits

- Thank you to the U of U and DevEx for helping with instructions and the skeleton of the project.



## License

- It has one, the base MIT license.
